This is a repackaged version of HoneyFox's excellent EngineIgnitor module.

It can be installed simply by unzipping into your GameData directory.

There are no extra bundled zips to unpackage, they now have ModuleManager directives so they will apply if appropriate.

This repack has only been tested with RealismOverhaul installed. It may contain bugs not in the original.
