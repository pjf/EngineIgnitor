This is a repackaged version of HoneyFox's excellent EngineIgnitor module.

There are no extra bundled zips to unpackage, they now have ModuleManager directives so they will apply if appropriate.

This repack has only been tested with RealismOverhaul installed. It may contain bugs not in the original.

This repack is intended for [CKAN](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN) compatibility. It is intended only to act as a bridging release until the CKAN can support the official EngineIgnitor releases.

You can find HoneyFox's original source at https://github.com/HoneyFox/EngineIgnitor.
