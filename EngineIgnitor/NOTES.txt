If you want to use only ignitor profiles provided by RealFuels' engine configs, you can ignore the "Ignitor Configs" zip file, otherwise extract that zip to this folder.
PressurizedFT config has modified some fuel tanks into pressurized ones (actually it's bladder tank but anyway this will be overhauled in later release, in which pressure-fed and bladder tank will be separated logics), including KW's pancake tanks, some of AIES' small tanks, NP's small fuel tank, some stock small fuel tanks, etc. And most of these small sized liquid engines are changed to be pressure-fed ones. They can only work when connected to a pressurized fuel tank.
